		<h1>Suggestion to the Functran layout</h1>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Go to <a href="query.html">query.html</a> to see how a translation would look like.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="list.html">list.html</a> to see how a listing of a function would look like.</li>
			<li>Go to <a href="layout.html">layout.html</a> to see how the frontpage would look like.</li>
		</ul>
		Some of the links are functional, but many aren't.
